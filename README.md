## BitlyDotNet
A (partial) .NET client for the bit.ly URL shortening service's REST APIs.
Currently supports querying for groups and shortening URLs on bitly's v4 API using the OAuth access token flow.

While there were a few other relatively up-to-date implementations available on GitHub and/or as NuGet packages, I didn't like the way they were written in terms of modularity and testability, So i wrote this one up.
There is no NuGet package at the moment, But that might come a bit later if needed.

PRs welcome!
